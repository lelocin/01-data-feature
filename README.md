# PPDS HW1 Data Feature 
This notebook explains my data feature that calculates total calories of a random recipe given a chosen cuisine. The two APIs are Edamam Recipe and Edamam Nutrition. 

## Purpose
This feature can help dieters by providing meal suggestions based on their preferences and assisting with calorie tracking. More broadly speaking, this feature can help anyone who simply needs recipes inspirations.
